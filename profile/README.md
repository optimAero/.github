# Who we are
We are an aerobotics design, build, and test house founded in 2018 and based in Tehachapi, CA. Our team is led by three Aerospace PhDs from Georgia Tech, supported by engineers with advanced degrees and extensive hands-on experience. We combine a passion for flight with deep technical expertise to deliver successful outcomes. We provide consulting services in Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC), UAS modeling and simulation, control algorithm development, system identification, and the capabilities listed below. Please check out our [website](https://optim.aero/) or [contact us](mailto:info@optim.aero).
